        <h2>We Replace Roofs And Install New Metal Roofs</h2>
        <p>Metal is a lightweight, strong, and recyclable product. Metal roofing is fire-safe, durable and requires less maintenance than roofs with tiles.
            Metal roofing also has an extremely long life span and can be coated in a range of environmentally friendly reflective coatings.
            
            For over 20 years AWS Roofing has carried out metal roof installations and replacements for clients on the Central Coast, The Hunter and Sydney. We advise our customers on the best methods and materials suitable to their situation and requirements.
            
            We offer a great variety of choices in terms of colours and profiles, as well as installation of accessories such as skylights, roof ventilation and more.</p>

        <h2>Why You Need Gutters</h2>
        <p>Incases of water damage to your home in a storm. If your gutters have been neglected, your insurance company may not cover you for the damage. Many policies will have it in the fine print that you need well maintained gutters.

            Many of our clients also get their fascia boards replaced when we do a guttering installation.
            Please see our fascia board information and product options.
            Do you need help with preventing leaves and debris from building up in your gutters? We can also install gutter guards at the same time.
            
            AWS Roofing offers a huge range of guttering profiles and a wide range of colours to complement any architectural style from modern homes to heritage buildings, commercial, and industrial properties.</p>
